# windows95

This is Windows 95, running in an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) app. Yes, it's the full thing. I'm sorry.

## Does it work?
Yes! Quite well, actually - on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Bear in mind that this is written entirely in JavaScript, so please adjust your expectations.

## Should this have been a native app?
Absolutely.

## Does it run Doom (or my other favorite game)?
You'll likely be better off with an actual virtualization app, but the short answer is yes. [Thanks to
@DisplacedGamers](https://youtu.be/xDXqmdFxofM) I can recommend that you switch to a resolution of
640x480 @ 256 colors before starting DOS games - just like in the good ol' days.

## Credits

99% of the work was done over at [v86](https://github.com/copy/v86/) by Copy aka Fabian Hemmer and his contributors.

## Contributing

Before you can run this from source, you'll need the disk image. It's not part of the
repository, but you can grab it using the `Show Disk Image` button from the packaged
release, which does include the disk image. You can find that button in the
`Modify C: Drive` section.

Unpack the `images` folder into the `src` folder, creating this layout:

```
- /images/windows95.img
- /images/default-state.bin
- /assets/...
- /bios/...
- /docs/...
```

Once you've done so, run `npm install` and `npm start` to run your local build.

If you want to tinker with the image or make a new one, check out the [QEMU docs](./docs/qemu.md).
